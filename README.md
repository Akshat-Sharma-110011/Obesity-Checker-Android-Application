Obesity Level Prediction App

📋 Overview

The Obesity Level Prediction App is an interactive application built using the KivyMD framework. It enables users to predict their obesity levels based on personal details, dietary habits, lifestyle choices, and physical activity. The app uses a pre-trained machine learning model to provide accurate predictions and offers a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

🚀 Features

Interactive User Interface: A sleek and responsive design for inputting personal, dietary, and lifestyle data.

Obesity Level Prediction: Powered by a machine learning model, the app predicts obesity levels with categories such as Normal Weight, Overweight, and Obesity Type I/II/III.

Feedback System: Allows users to provide feedback on their experience.

Multi-Screen Navigation: Organized into multiple screens for a streamlined data collection process.

Real-Time Alerts: Displays predictions and feedback submission statuses using dialog boxes.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Framework: KivyMD for a modern UI design.

Backend: Machine Learning model trained on obesity-related data.

Programming Language: Python.

Model Handling: Pickle for loading the pre-trained model.

🏗️ Application Architecture

The app is divided into several screens:

1. Personal Details: Collects basic information like gender, age, height, and weight.


2. Diet and Family History: Gathers data about diet preferences and family health history.


3. Lifestyle and Monitoring: Captures details about smoking, water intake, and calorie monitoring.


4. Physical Activity and Transport: Assesses physical activity frequency and preferred modes of transportation.


5. Feedback: A platform for users to share their thoughts on the app.

⚙️ Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to run the app locally:

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/obesity-prediction-app.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd obesity-prediction-app


3. Install the required dependencies:

pip install kivy kivymd numpy


4. Ensure the pre-trained model file (obesity_pipeline.pkl) is in the project directory.


5. Run the application:

python App.py

🧠 How It Works

1. Users enter their details across the different screens.


2. The app preprocesses the input and feeds it into the pre-trained model.


3. A prediction is generated, categorizing the user's obesity level.


4. The result is displayed, followed by an optional feedback submission screen.
